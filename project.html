        <h2>Bad Bunny</h2>
        <p>Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio (born March 10, 1994), known professional as Bad Bunny, is a Puerto Rican rapper, singer, and record, producer.</p>
        <p>He is known as the "King of Latin Trap" and holds the second-biggest streaming year of any artist in Spotify history. As of December 2023, his album Un Verano Sin Ti is the most streamed album on Spotify with over 14 billion streams. He not only has released 7 albums, but has a large variety of singles and is feautred in many more. He has collaborated with many other artists, both in and out of the Latin genre. He's had 5 tours in total, spanning from 2018 to 2024. He's earned a number of awards and nominations, including 11 Latin Grammy Awards out of 27 nominations. Apart from his role in the music industry, he has held the occupation of actor and professional wrestler.</p>
        <p>Bad Bunny has been my favorite artist since 2018 when I first heard his x100Pre album. Since then, I've been a loyal fan and have never stopped listening to his music. Over the years I've learned and heard the majority of his songs, ad have even been to two of his tours - World's Hottest Tour and Most Wanted Tour. Although I realize the genres of his music are not for everyone, I believe that he has a lot of variety in his music types and believe that most people could find a song or album that fits their taste, even if they don't know the language.</p>
        <p>Due to my never-ending and enormous love for Bad Bunny's music, I decided to base my project on him and his career.</p>
