        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Rubeus Hagrid, the groundskeeper at Hogwarts, informs Harry Potter at the age of 11 that he is a wizard, taking him to the wizarding world where he soon learns his parents were murdered by the powerful dark wizard Lord Voldemort. However, Voldemort's killing curse on Harry mysteriously rebounded, reducing the dark wizard to a helpless form, and giving Harry his lightning-shaped scar.  </p>
        <p>Harry begins his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a boarding school of magic for young wizards. At Hogwarts, we see Harry learning about magic, becoming friends with Ron and Hermione, and becoming entangled in the mystery of the Sorcerer's Stone which is kept within the school.</p>

        <h2 class="cutfloat">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)</h2>  
        <p>Harry returns to Hogwarts for their second year, which proves to be more challenging than the last. The Chamber of Secrets has been opened, leaving students and ghosts petrified by an unleashed monster. Harry faces claims that he is the heir of Salazar Slytherin (founder of the Chamber), learns that he can speak Parseltongue, and also discovers the properties of a mysterious diary, only to find himself trapped within the Chamber itself on a mission to save his best friend Ron's sister from the evil traps of Voldemort.</p>

      <section id="prisoner">
        <h2>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)</h2>
        <p>In Harry's third year, he returns to school knowing that convicted murderer Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban, the wizarding world's prison. Alongside the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Professor R. J. Lupin, and his friends, he learns of his connection with the prisoner, who is actually his godfather and who, in reality, did not commit the crime he was convicted for. Together, they all help Black escape and go on the run.</p>
<!--           
        <p>As the Ministry of Magic entrusts Dementors - magical beings that guard Azkaban and have the ability to drain a person's happiness - to guard Hogwarts, chaos erupts as they endanger and scare the students. They almost perform the Dementor's kiss - sucking the soul out of a person - on Black, which would have occured if not for Harry saving him with a Patronus charm.</p>
