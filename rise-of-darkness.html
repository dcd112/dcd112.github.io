        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Throughout films 4-6, Harry Potter's battle against Lord Voldemort truly begings and escalates, shifting the focus from Harry's school life and his discovery of the wizarding world to the growing threat surrounding him. Him and his friends face increasing dangers as Harry takes on a greater responsibility in the fight against Voldemort.</p>

        <h2>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005)</h2>
        <p>During the fourth year, Hogwarts is host to the Triwizard Tournament, in which three European wizarding schools participate, including Hogwarts. However, Harry's name is also produced from the Goblet of Fire - which chooses the "champion" from each school who will compete. He is made the irregular fourth champion, and the final competition in the tournament leads to his encounter with a reborn Lord Voldemort, when Voldemort attempts the killing curse on Harry which he then deflects. Harry barely escapes, and makes it back to the school to inform everyone that Voldemort is back. </p>

        <h2>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007)</h2>
        <p>Harry's fifth year begins with him being attacked by Dementors in Little Whinging and with the discovery that the Ministry of Magic is in denial of Lord Voldemort's return. Harry is also beset by disturbing yet realistic nightmares, while Professor Umbridge, a representative of Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, is the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Harry becomes aware that Voldemort is after a prophecy which reveals: "neither can live while the other survives". The rebellion involving the students of Hogwarts, secret organisation Order of the Phoenix, the Ministry of Magic, and the Death Eaters begins. </p>

        <h2>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</h2>
        <p>In Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters are increasing their terror upon the Wizarding and Muggle worlds. Albus Dumbledore persuades his old friend Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts as a professor as there is a vacancy to fill. There is a more important reason, however, for Slughorn's return. While in a Potions lesson, Harry takes possession of a strangely annotated school textbook, inscribed as belonging to the 'Half-Blood Prince',  who is later uncovered to be Severus Snape. All throughout, Dumbledore and Harry secretly work together to discover how to destroy the Dark Lord once and for all.</p>
